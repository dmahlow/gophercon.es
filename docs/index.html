        <h1>Building Modules Discovery</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Today Go users are forced to visit a number of different sites to find packages. To solve this problem, the Go team is building a modules discovery site. In this talk, I will discuss how to go about</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Julie Qiu is a software engineer on the Go team at Google, where she is leading the project to build the Go discovery site for modules. Before Google she was already working in Go as an engineering lead at Spring to improve search performance, personalize the user shopping experience, and ingest real-time product updates at scale. She graduated from Yale University with a degree in Cognitive Science.</p>

        <h1>The Athens Project - A Proxy Server for Go Modules</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Go 1.11 introduced modules, the new standard package management system for Go. It’s a massive step forward for the community, especially because we can build proxy servers instead of just using Github to fetch code. Athens is leading the way to solve some painful problems we’ve had for years.</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Aaron is a Sr. Developer Advocate at Microsoft Azure, creator of and core maintainer to the Athens Project. Before Athens, he was a core maintainer and chair of the Kubernetes Service Catalog special interest group (SIG-Service-Catalog) and a contributor to various other projects in the Kubernetes community.

He has almost 15 years of software engineering experience and when he discovered Go around 2013, he hasn’t looked back. He lives in San Mateo, CA where he and his wife love to run up and down mountains together.</p>

        <h1>LinuxBoot: Firmware Tools &amp; a busybox in Go</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Come learn about how we’re replacing closed source UEFI firmware with Linux and Go!
LinuxBoot replaces parts of firmware with a small Linux kernel and initramfs. Our initramfs consists of pure Go system programs such as bootloaders, and we’ll talk about our BusyBox scheme to keep it small.</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Chris Koch is a Software Engineer at Google in the Security & Privacy group working on bringing open source firmware to the world and Google. Previously, he worked on gVisor, a sandbox and “kernel” largely written in Go.</p>

<h1>API Gateway, A Success Story (Joined Talk)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Talking about microservices we have to think about how to secure the system without losing the advantage of the decoupling and without adding too much latency. We implemented a custom API gateway. Why? Because it can easily scale, adds almost zero latency, is an ad hoc solution and it was fun!</p>

        <h1>Psychology of Code Readability</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Much of the existing software literature that teaches how to write readable code focuses on “rules of thumb” rather than comparing and dissecting real examples of code readability. Psychology provides various concepts that allow developers to identify code that is readable versus code that isn’t.</p>

<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Egon Elbre is a software engineer with over 10 years of experience. He started playing with Go just after the first public announcement and has hung around since then. He loves finding new ways of looking at code such that it would be easier to maintain, understand and, most of all, ensure that it delivers value. He strongly believes that there are explanations that help people learn and be productive faster. When he’s not neck deep in code he’s either drawing or playing the piano.</p>

        <h1>Everything You Wanted to Know About Distributed Tracing in Go</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In the age of microservices, understanding how applications are executing in a highly distributed environment can be complicated. Looking at log files only gives a snapshot of the whole story and looking at a single service in isolation simply does not give enough information. Each service is just one side of a bigger story. Distributed tracing has emerged as an invaluable technique that succeeds in summarizing all sides of the story into a shared timeline. Yet deploying it can be quite challenging, especially in the large scale, polyglot environments of modern companies that mix together many different technologies. During this session, we will take a look at patterns and means to implement Tracing for services. After introducing the basic concepts we will cover how the tracing model works, and how to safely use it in production to troubleshoot and diagnose issues.</p>

        <h1>Advanced Ultimate Go</h1>


<p>This class has been designed over the past 4 years and goes beyond just being a Go language class. There will be very little time spent on specific Go syntax. Our time will be spent learning how to read and understand Go code with a big focus of "if performance matters" then these things matter. During the day we will talk about code design, semantics, guidelines, mechanical sympathy and data oriented design.</p>

<h2>Language Mechanics / Semantics</h2>

<ul>
<li>- Pointers</li>
<li>- Data Semantics</li>
<li>- Control Flow Design</li>
<li>- Decoupling Mechanics</li>
<li>- Compositional Design</li>
</ul>

<h2>What a student is expected to learn</h2>
<p>Everyone is going to be mentally exhausted by the end of the day. We will be challenging every student to think about what they are doing and why. In the 4 years we have taught this material, we never had someone not appreciate the class and feel like they are a better developer for it. If you want to be a better Go developer, code reviewer, designer and architect, this is the class you want to take.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>A basic understanding of the Go programming language. Students do not have to be expert Go users but they will get the most from the workshop if they have completed the majority of the Go Tour.</p>

        <h1>Advanced Testing Techniques</h1>

<p>Whether you are just getting started in Go or have been writing Go code for a couple years, this class will make sure you have what you need to write simple, quick, robust tests. We will start with the basics, and work through advanced concepts such as testing asynchronous code, as well as mocking and injecting code. We'll finish up with looking at some popular testing libraries and CI (continuous integration) approaches. We believe in a hands-on approach to learning, so bring your laptops and be ready to write a lot of tests! What a student is expected to learn: Everyone will have a strong understanding of each part of testing.</p>

<p>The test package will be covered in depth, different approaches to table-driven testing will be taught, as well as the numerous options for running tests and test suites. From there, a deep dive into unit, api, and system level testing will be covered. Students will learn how to test Net/HTTP packages, and how to mock out tests and create test harnesses. TDD (Test Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior Driven Development) will be covered, and testing packages that correspond to each will be presented as well. Finally, students will learn the basics on setting up Continuous integration both locally and at the server.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: A basic understanding of the Go programming language. Beginners are highly encouraged to attend this training. While not necessary, it will be helpful if you have completed the <a href="https://tour.golang.org">Go tour</a>.</p>

<h2>Testing Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li>*testing.T</li>
<li>Error vs. Fatal</li>
<li>Failure Messages</li>
<li>Running go test</li>
<li>Test Arguments and options</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unit, API, And System Level Testing</h2>
<p>There are many different approaches to testing your code. The most common ones are Unit, API, and Sytem Level testing. There are also other ways to refer to these levels of testing, such as White Box, Black Box, and Integration testing. This module will cover the pros and cons of both, as well as demonstrate what makes a good test using the different approaches.</p>

<h2>Table Driven Testing</h2>
<p>Table driven tests can be used to cover a lot of ground quickly while re-using common setup and comparison code. Table driven testing is not unique to Go, however, it is very powerful. In this module we will cover the different ways to create, run, and isolate table driven tests.</p>

<h2>Testing With Net/HTTP</h2>
<p>Testing Net/HTTP applications can be challenging. Luckily, Go addresses this and ships specific testing packages designed to use in testing Net/HTTP applications. This module will cover the different ways to do both unit testing and integration testing for these types of applications.</p>

<h2>Mocking Tests</h2>
<p>It&#39;s easy to decouple packages in Go using interfaces. Because of this, testing can also be much easier. However, you typically want to mock out your interfaces in tests so that unit testing is much easier. This chapter will cover how to write a mock for a service to enable easy and precise testing.</p>

<h2>Test Harness</h2>
<p>Test Harnesses are a common practice used to test complex parts of your program under varying conditions. Test harnesses are often used for conditions and/or use cases that are otherwise difficult to simulate (load, for example). This module will show how to build test harnesses for reuse and ease of complex testing scenarios.</p>

<h2>Testing Asynchronous Tasks</h2>
<p>Many times you may be testing parts of your code that have service dependency that run for an unknown amount of time. Examples of these may be task queues, distributed system calls, etc. Because you don't know how long they may take to execute, testing them can present some challenges. In this module we will learn how to set up tests both effectively and efficiently for testing async processes.</p>

<h2>Test Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is an advanced technique of using automated unit tests to drive the design of software and force decoupling of dependencies. The motto of TDD is Red, Green, Refactor. This module will cover the common setup and automation to create a very rapid, efficient, and productive feedback cycle for TDD style testing.</p>

<h2>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)</h2>
<p>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) was derived from TDD. Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.</p>

<h2>Testify</h2>
<p>Testify is a toolkit with common assertions and mocks that plays nicely with the standard library. Outside of the standard library, it is the most imported package in the Go ecosystem. This module will cover the basics of how to use and implement this common testing package.</p>

<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer copies to a shared mainline several times per day to determine if any specific code is going to break or adversely affect the project. There are numerous CI tools at our disposal today. This module will cover not only the more common tools, but best practice strategies to get the most out of your CI setup. It will also over pre-ci steps that are common for developers to use to catch situations that will break the build prior to even being sent to the ci service.</p>

<h2>Finalize</h2>
<p>This module covers where to get more support on Go, recommends books and videos, and list contact information for our instructors.</p>

        <h1>Production ready cloud-native services<br /> with Go and Kubernetes</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>It is easy to fall in love with a new programming language, tool or architectural approach, especially as it gains in popularity. Usually, we start trying new technology by understanding a &quot;tour&quot; or the &quot;quick start&quot; guidance. However, in practice, it is not always so simple to bridge the gap between our first web server and a real production-ready application, this is especially true if this application should be prepared for a cloud-native infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="what-a-student-is-expected-to-learn-">What a student is expected to learn:</h3>
<p>This workshop presents one of the possible strategies for writing cloud-native services with Go and Kubernetes. During the workshop, we will discuss how to design stable, scalable, reliable and performant applications. Step by step, we will write a service from scratch and prepare it for deployment. We will try continuous integration and continuous delivery with a prepared Kubernetes platform and discuss the benefits of this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements for cloud-native services</li>
<li>How to structure a Go application</li>
<li>Code quality</li>
